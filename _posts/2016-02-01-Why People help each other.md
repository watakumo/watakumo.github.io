Helping others is considered as virtue.
It is just right and natural to human.
But is that all about moral thing?
Why people help others? Even there is no legal liability and no benefits, people help each other and make circle with their hands.

I think it is a programmed
instinct that makes us survive. More dramatically saying: ‘ Yes. we are all survival system.

Actually this expression was described in one of the famous biological book, ‘The Selfish
Gene’ written by Richard Dawkins. In Dawkins’ theory all organism, especially, the animal is
a slave of gene. The gene makes animals to do development, metabolism, reproduction,
evolution. The phenomenon that people help others can be defined as ‘Altruism’.
And this altruism is common in ethology -biological science study about animal behavior-.
There are two excuses of this altruism. From now on, I will try to explain the reason of human species’ altruism in an aspect of biology.

Improvement of survival rate is the first reason of human species’ altruism. As we more cooperate each other, the more possibility of survive. Assume one situation that 10 people stuck in a desert island. If they do competition each other, they could be dead very easily. There would be no help for someone who in a danger.( Ex. Fall from Steep cliff. )

So it is wise to help each other and call a help from others.
It is a win-win strategy. One of other example of this thing could be the social organization of bees. Bees divide their social jobs and duty into hierarchical class. But they do their best in any class. This power of organization makes them survive in a harsh outside.      

The second reason for the altruism is more macroscopic. In a view of conservation of human species, the sacrifice of one individual makes it easier to conserve that specific species.

Have you ever a series of movie that one adult (usually parents or man) sacrifices himself for
their children or girl. In biologically it is true that a child or a girl is more valuable than adult and man. Even more it is common sense in a society. Gentle man’s manners, and the chivalry is one of results of this phenomenon.More exactly the honor and benefits in return of honor
is come from this concept.           

In the Dawkins’ book, the animals seem to be governed by their gene. It is more true
to the low-level animals like insects. And also humans can be explained their altruism
behavior. Of Couse this biologic factors are not the only reason for our humanity. Because we
are more complicate than animals. But In a biological aspect, the most important purpose of
our life is eternal succession of the gene. This is a fate of all organisms. So… the reason why
people help each other could be this one. Because we are survival systems in biological
organism view.
